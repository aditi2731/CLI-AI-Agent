# CLI AI Agent - Your Smart Terminal Companion

### What does it actually do?
It's basically a web-based terminal that has an AI buddy sitting right next to it. When you run commands and something breaks the AI automatically jumps in and explains what went wrong and how to fix it.

### Features:-
* Real terminal: Not just a fake simulation - it actually runs your commands.
* Smart AI helper: Uses Groq's super fast AI to analyze errors and suggest fixes.
* Split screen: Terminal on the left, AI chat on the right - no more switching between tabs.
* Command history: Arrow keys work just like in a real terminal.
* Actually useful suggestions: The AI understands context and gives practical advice.

  ### How I built it:
  I used Flask for the backend because it's simple and gets the job done. The frontend is just vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.The AI part uses Groq's API .

  ### Why might you find this useful?
  - You're learning command line stuff and need help.
  - You work with terminals daily and want faster error resolution.
  - You're tired of context-switching between terminal and browser.
  - You want to see what modern AI can do with terminal assistance.
